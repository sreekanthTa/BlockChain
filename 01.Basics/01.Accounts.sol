// HOW CAN WE CONNECT TO THE ETHERIUM NETWORK ?
// For developers => Web3.js
// For Consumers => MetaMask

// META MASK CONTAINS => 1. Account address => 0x98s4dg9s4f9gh84w9sg489sdfg4sdfg
//                       2. Public Key  =>0xs9gd8dfb5df64gd4sdf6g84sd9g9d8f
//                       3. Private Key => 0xbsg984sg984sf9d9df84fd65dg98
 
//   1. Account Address => It is an user identifier like an email address
//   2. Public Key + Private key => Act as a password for the account
//   3. We should not share Private Keys since it is Private key, we shar eonly Public Key
//   Note: We will use The One Account across all Etherium Network
