## Block Time

### Definition
**Block time** is the average time it takes for a new block to be added (mined) and confirmed on the blockchain.  
- In Bitcoin, the **average block time is around 10 minutes**.  
- In Ethereum, it’s shorter — around 12–15 seconds per block.

### How Block Time Works
1. **Transactions are broadcast:** Users send transactions to the network.  
2. **Transactions enter the mempool:** Miners pick pending transactions to include in a block.  
3. **Mining the block:** Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle (Proof-of-Work).  
4. **Block added to the chain:** Once a miner solves the puzzle, the block is added, and the block time is recorded.

### Why Block Time Varies
Block time is **not fixed** — it depends on several factors:  
1. **Mining difficulty:**  
   - The blockchain adjusts difficulty to maintain an average block time.  
   - If miners are faster (more computing power), the difficulty increases; if slower, difficulty decreases.  
2. **Network congestion:**  
   - More transactions can slightly increase block processing time.  
3. **Randomness in mining:**  
   - Mining is probabilistic — some miners may solve the puzzle faster than others, causing small variations.

### Real-World Analogy
- Imagine a **lottery where tickets are drawn continuously**:  
  - Each lottery draw represents a block being mined.  
  - The “time between draws” is like the block time.  
  - Sometimes, a winner is found quickly, sometimes it takes longer.  
  - The lottery organizers adjust rules to keep the average interval consistent.

### Key Points
- **Block time determines transaction confirmation speed.**  
- **Shorter block times** → faster confirmations but more chances of temporary forks.  
- **Longer block times** → slower confirmations but fewer forks.  
- Block time **helps balance security, speed, and decentralization**.

### Example
- Bitcoin: ~10 minutes per block → a transaction usually gets 1 confirmation in 10 minutes.  
- Ethereum: ~13 seconds per block → a transaction gets 1 confirmation in ~13 seconds.  

✅ Understanding block time helps users and developers **estimate transaction confirmations** and **design blockchain applications** efficiently.
