# Smart Contract Function Declarations

This README provides a complete reference for Solidity function types, their purpose, and usage examples in **table format**.

---

| **Function Type** | **Description** | **When to Use** | **Example** |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Public** | Accessible from **inside** the contract, by **other contracts**, and by **external users**. | When you want a function to be usable both internally and externally. | ```solidity\nfunction setValue(uint _value) public {\n    value = _value;\n}\n``` |
| **Private** | Accessible only **within the same contract**. Not visible to derived contracts or external callers. | For internal helper logic that must not be exposed. | ```solidity\nfunction _logValue() private {\n    // Internal-only logic\n}\n``` |
| **Internal** | Accessible from **within the contract** and by **derived (child) contracts**. | When sharing logic with inherited contracts but hiding it from external callers. | ```solidity\nfunction _calculate(uint a, uint b) internal pure returns (uint) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n``` |
| **External** | Can only be called from **outside** the contract (or via `this.fn()` internally). | For public-facing entry points that should not be used internally. | ```solidity\nfunction setValue(uint _value) external {\n    value = _value;\n}\n``` |
| **View** | Cannot modify state but can **read** state variables. | When you need to fetch contract data without changing it. | ```solidity\nfunction getValue() public view returns (uint) {\n    return value;\n}\n``` |
| **Pure** | Cannot read or modify state. Used for calculations only. | When function depends only on inputs and not contract state. | ```solidity\nfunction add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n``` |
| **Payable** | Allows the contract to receive Ether. | For deposits or payments. | ```solidity\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n    // msg.value holds Ether sent\n}\n``` |
| **Fallback** | Executes when no function matches or when data is sent with a call. Can be `payable`. | To handle unknown function calls or raw data. | ```solidity\nfallback() external payable {\n    // Handle unmatched calls\n}\n``` |
| **Receive** | Special function to receive Ether when `msg.data` is empty. | For direct ETH transfers without function calls. | ```solidity\nreceive() external payable {\n    // Handle plain ETH transfers\n}\n``` |

## Summary Table: Accessibility

| **Function Type** | **Inside Contract** | **Derived Contracts** | **External Callers** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Public            | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Private           | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Internal          | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| External          | ❌ (must call via `this`) | ✅ | ✅ |

## Best Practices
- **Use `private` or `internal`** for helper functions to reduce attack surface.
- **Prefer `external` over `public`** for functions meant only for outside use (saves gas).
- **Use `view` and `pure`** when possible to save gas and improve clarity.
- **Secure `payable` functions** with checks (e.g., reentrancy protection).
- **Fallback and receive functions** should be simple and protected (avoid heavy logic).
